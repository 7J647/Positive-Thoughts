## Introduction 

This "Project-3" of the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Full-time Coding program was an opportunity to work with our peers to "pull everything together" that we have learned through the cohort.  We were instructed to build a full-stack MERN application utilizing MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, the four technologies that make up the stack.  This was to be accomplished while having a polished front-end/UI, a folder structure meeting the MVC paradigm, and incorporating good quality coding standards.  Additional requirements included:
    1)  Having both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
    2)  Deploying to Heroku with data.
    3)  Utilizing at least 2 new libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed in class. 
    4)  Authenticating users in some way.

The app also had to be responsive.

## Description

The concept/idea for this project came from group member Andrew Marcus and the inspiration for it was his interest in helping the many people that suffer from anxiety and depression.  Fellow group member Jamie Jones shares this passion so it was a natural fit for our project subject.

Positive Thoughts is a mental health companion app that is intended to improve oneâ€™s outlook with the power of positive thinking.  2020 has been a rough year to say the least and according to the American Psychological Association (https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/10/stress-mental-health-crisis), this has led to a mental health crisis.  We think a mental health site is an effective means of helping people. Rick Nauert PhD agrees with us and a study backing up this hypothesis was conducted by Brigham Young University. (https://psychcentral.com/news/2017/11/21/mobile-apps-can-help-manage-and-support-mental-emotional-health/129055.html ) Also, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America is actively looking for mobile-apps that can help people that are struggling (https://adaa.org/finding-help/mobile-apps).  The times in which we live mean that we need to combat anxiety now more than ever.

You don't really need any organizations though to back up our premise because in our opinion it is obvious.  The primary function of the Positive Thoughts is to automatically send positive and inspirational messages to the user via text message in order to give them a little bit of a lift when they might need one.

Our user story is as follows:

--AS A: person who is doing my best to get through these very trying times
--I WANT: an app that acts as a digital cheerleader bringing me uplifting notifications throughout the day
--SO THAT: I can keep Positive Thoughts going and keep persevering as best I can.

One aspect of this project that makes it stand out is the use of a scrolling, "starry night" background.  Just opening the app will at the very least have some calming effect on a user's current outlook.  This background was carefully chosen and was difficult to install because just a couple of weeks before installing the code had been updated.  However the updated code had bugs which required an installation of a previous version instead.

## Features

Besides the starry night background, this website application uses Twilio and Cron to send a user various messages via text.  These were both new libraries/technologies and neither concept was discussed during our class, it was like being stuck between Scylla and Charybdis.  The messages currently are in one category and are randomly chosen.  They can all be viewed together on the app's "Prompts" page.  

Through the use of another new library, JSONwebtoken, we authenticate users and prevent those who are logged in from being able to view the login or signup pages.  Users that are not logged in cannot view certain pages such as Profile and Prompts.

Our app also includes a Hotlines page which has a list of mental health hotlines and websites just in case the user needs them.

Positive-Thoughts uses a MongoDB called "positive-thoughts" with two collections, Users and Messages.

Once a user has created an account they are taken to their profile page.  From here a user can update their profile information, sign out, or delete their account.  If they click on the Delete Account button they are presented with a Confirm to make sure this is what they want to do.

<br>
<br>
On the Edit page, a user can update any of the fields and click on Update Account, their account will then be updated.  A user can also click on Cancel and be returned back to the profile page.

With special thanks to TA Peter Colella without who's help we would not have been able to accomplish this project.  Thanks also to TA Leif Hetland for his assistance and to TA Christina Starr for her help as well.  Though we didn't work with TA Philip Simmons we want to thank him for all of his help throughout the cohort and thank you to Instructor Jonathan Watson for all of his efforts these last few months.
